# Global Population Trends:
Project/Goals
Global Population Trends Data from  2016 - 2022 in which we did a analysis on the few parameters like Urban and rural population, infant mortality rate, birth and death rate, life expectancy, etc. In order to analyze and compare population trends and explore the fascinating world of demographics and population trends across different countries.

Process
(Step 1: Search the Database from Kaggle website i.e: Global Population Trends)
(Step 2: Data Cleaning using PostgreSql)
(Part 3: Worked on EDA)
(Step 4: Tabaleu)
(Step 5: Future Goals)

(Part 1: Search the Database)
Started the searching the database for data analysis and we downloaded the database from the kaggle fro analysis.

(Part 2: Data Cleaning using PostgreSql)
Created the database in the SQL, afterwards I started creating the table and its colums. Then, changed the data type of the coulms as per the data. Imported the data from the csv file into the table. 
after all this, I started cleaning the data using the few parameter.
I had took these steps to clean data: removed: (irrelevant, redundant, or duplicate data, Clean “structural” issues, Type conversion, Clean missing data, Clean outliers, Validate). I had also taken numerous steps to clean the data

(Part 3: Worked on EDA)
In EDA, we created the question in order to make the analysis of data. In order find the negative growth rate, urban vs rural population and Life expectancy vs growth rate and did the analysis on these basis to get to know about the pattern of growth rate of the population and dynamiv changes.

(Part 4: Tabaleu)
In Tabaleau, in this we have created a story line for the dashboard on the basis of the question like death rate analysis, urban vs rural growth rate and made the analysis on the data.

(Part 6: Furure Goals)
Use API to pull the more data from the different sources in order to make the better analysis. Also, create a professional dashboard and use some different charts. Last, Also improve the QA process and check the relaibility of the database.

Challenges
(Some challenges that I had experienced include: Null values, having to change time, and having to manually add columns as well as numerous transformations and data cleaning. There was also missing values, Inconsistent data that creates confusion, incorrect data, value entered in the wrong field, Errors in columns/tables and missing/null values.)

Future Goals
(What would you do if you had more time?) (Answer: If I had more time I would go more in-depth with the data cleaning process, transformations, troubleshooting, and educate others about what I had learned and try to learn more.)
